Convert a string of YUY422 to RGB888
YUV422 is converted 4 bytes into two pixels, i.e. 4 bytes -> 6 bytes

the yuv is stores as:
v y1 u y2

where each one is 8 bits, and encodes the relevant values for the whole 2
pixels, except the y's which are one for each pixel.

Note that this is actually Y C_b C_r and not YUV (talking colour spaces)
